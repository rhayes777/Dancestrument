# Dancestrument
Make a Dance Revolution USB dancemat into a midi instrument.

Generates and sends midi messages to play notes and chords in a particular key/scale as dancemat buttons are pressed.

A synth must be running. SimpleSynth can be used on Mac:

Edit dancestrument.py to change the key and scale. Press 'SELECT' and 'START' to switch down and up octaves.
